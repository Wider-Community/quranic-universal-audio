"""Mark-ready submission wire schemas.

A reviewer "marks ready" by submitting a checklist + two optional comment
boxes. The handler in ``services/state/state.py`` validates this payload,
then ``repo_claims.set_marked_ready`` persists it on the open claim. The
admin Reviews drawer surfaces both checklist + comments back to the
maintainer reviewing the submission.

The five checklist keys MUST stay in lockstep with the FE copy module at
``inspector/frontend/src/tabs/segments/copy/mark-ready/index.ts`` — both
sides declare them as a literal union and a parity test in the FE
``__tests__`` guards drift.

FE-facing: re-exported from ``fe_types.py`` and code-generated into
``inspector/frontend/src/lib/types/generated/schemas.ts`` via
``inspector/scripts/regen_fe_types.py``.
