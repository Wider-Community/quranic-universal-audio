"""Admin-dashboard Requests-tab wire schemas.

Read model served by ``GET /api/admin/requests``. Timestamps are ISO-8601 UTC
strings exactly as stored (TEXT columns); the FE formats them. Requester /
resolver identity fields are present only for owner callers (maintainers see
the role alone). ``ConfigDict(extra="allow")`` per the schema convention.

FE-facing: re-exported from ``fe_types.py`` and code-generated into
``inspector/frontend/src/lib/types/generated/schemas.ts`` via
``inspector/scripts/regen_fe_types.py``.
