# inspector-admin

Headless one-off admin ops. Every script wraps the same `inspector/services/admin/*` + `inspector/services/state/state.transition` the UI calls — no parallel logic, no schema drift. Use when:

- a quick prod patch is needed and walking through the UI is wasteful
- the UI doesn't expose an op you need (raw SQL, bulk state flip, lookup-by-id)
- iterating on something that just failed (cancel stuck job, force-publish, etc.)

## Knowledge — pointers, not narration

Don't re-derive subsystem facts in this skill. Open the reference doc.

| Concept | Reference |
|---|---|
| State machine — lifecycle states, valid events per state, payload shape, `transition()` semantics | [`docs/reference/state-machine.md`](../../../docs/reference/state-machine.md) |
| Capabilities — which gate guards which action, owner-only set, the resolver | [`docs/reference/capabilities.md`](../../../docs/reference/capabilities.md) |
| Auth / OAuth / actor — `Actor` record, edit-lock, CSRF, role tiers | [`docs/reference/auth-permissions.md`](../../../docs/reference/auth-permissions.md) |
| Admin UI surface — Users / Reviews / Permissions / Requests compartments, `/api/admin/*` shape | [`docs/reference/admin-dashboard.md`](../../../docs/reference/admin-dashboard.md) |
| SQLite substrate — `durable_transaction`, db_seq CAS, bucket sync mechanics | [`docs/reference/database.md`](../../../docs/reference/database.md) |
| Catalog layers + slug convention + audio manifest sidecar | [`docs/reference/catalog.md`](../../../docs/reference/catalog.md) |
| TS-job format + lifecycle + webhook + poll fallback + publish path | [`docs/reference/timestamps-job.md`](../../../docs/reference/timestamps-job.md) |
| Env vars + `INSPECTOR_BUCKET_REPO` / `INSPECTOR_ALLOW_PROD_BUCKET` semantics | [`docs/reference/config-deploy.md`](../../../docs/reference/config-deploy.md) |

Always open the matching reference before invoking a mutation — the event name + payload shape come from `state-machine.md`, the gate comes from `capabilities.md`. Don't guess.

## Scripts

Every script:
- defaults to the dev bucket; `--prod` for prod
- mutating ops against prod additionally require `--yes-prod` on the command line (no env opt-in)
- `--dry-run` runs the handler up to (but not through) `durable_transaction`
- writes audit entries as the real `INSPECTOR_DEV_OWNER_HF_ID`/`_LOGIN` from `.env` so prod audit doesn't show `dev-owner`
- **post-write health gate** — after the prod pause→write→resume, `prod_safe_setup` doesn't stop at `stage == RUNNING` (container up). It polls `/healthz` until the app answers, then renders the catalog endpoints (`/api/public/reciters`, `/api/public/stats`) which read the `deliveries`/catalog rows through the Pydantic models. A write that creates a row failing model validation leaves the Space RUNNING but every catalog read 500s — the gate catches exactly that, prints a loud `POST-WRITE HEALTH CHECK FAILED` banner, and exits non-zero. **A raw `admin_db.py exec --write` bypasses the repo/model layer, so this gate is the only validation safety net — heed it.** (Origin: a raw `UPDATE deliveries SET bitrate_mode='mixed'` that left `bitrate_kbps_nominal` non-null, which the `Delivery` validator forbids → catalog 500s.)

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `scripts/admin_state.py SLUG --event EVENT [--reason R] [--payload '{...}']` | Generic `state.transition` wrapper. Event names → see `state-machine.md`. |
| `scripts/admin_publish.py SLUG --job-id JOB_ID` | `complete_timestamps_job`: under_review+marked_ready → released. Used when the deployed Space's webhook missed a callback. |
| `scripts/admin_ts_job.py {launch,cancel,status,record,history,publish,monitor} SLUG [JOB_ID] [...]` | TS-job lifecycle CLI (one home for what `launch_ts_job.py` used to do, plus cancel/status/publish). |
| `scripts/admin_release.py {preview,cut,monitor} [JOB_ID] [...]` | GH release preview + cut helper using the shared release-preview renderer and cut-release job service. |
| `scripts/admin_claim.py SLUG {show,release,reassign} [--to LOGIN]` | Force-release or reassign a claim. |
| `scripts/admin_users.py {list,show,grant,revoke} [--hf-id ID] [--login L] [--role owner\|maintainer\|contributor]` | User mgmt — list, look up, change role. |
| `scripts/admin_requests.py {list,show,resolve} [REQUEST_ID]` | Browse and act on the request queue. |
| `scripts/admin_perms.py {matrix,set,reset} [--cap ID --tier T --allowed {0,1}]` | Owner-only capability overrides. |
| `scripts/admin_db.py exec "SQL" [--write]` | Raw SQL against the pulled DB. Read-only by default; `--write` opens the writer + syncs back. |
| `scripts/admin_reciter.py SLUG` | One-shot dump: state row, claim, recent transitions, linked TS-job ids+statuses, bucket file inventory. |
| `scripts/admin_catalog.py {reciter,delivery,source,channel,vocab} {list,show,add,edit} [...]` | Catalog CRUD over `services/state/catalog.py` — reciter/delivery/source/channel add+edit, vocab/list/show reads. `edit` surface mirrors the service (reciter: name/country/notes; delivery: riwayah/style/recording_context/recording_year). |

## Prod writes MUST be single-writer (`prod_safe_setup`)

The DB sync goes through `durable_transaction` so the new bytes land on the bucket before the script returns. **But** a bare `setup()` write against prod is *not durable*: the deployed Space is a second, live writer whose `db_seq` advances on every commit (visitor/activity heartbeats), so it overtakes the sync CAS — which only refuses a *lower* seq — and **clobbers the out-of-band edit within a minute or two**. (Observed: a reconcile of 11 ledger rows reverted to 5 after the Space's next write.)

The safe path is **single-writer**: pause the Space → pull fresh → mutate → resume.

**Every script routes through `bs.run` — you don't call `setup` directly.** `run` takes the handler and two intent flags and picks the safe path automatically:

```python
from _bootstrap import run, add_common_args
add_common_args(p); a = p.parse_args()
write = a.cmd in ("set", "reset")          # this subcommand's intent
return bs.run(
    a,
    lambda ctx: DISPATCH[a.cmd](a, ctx),
    need_actor=write,     # construct the Actor (audit) for writes
    mutates=write,        # any prod side effect → enforces --yes-prod
    safe_write=write,     # IN-PROCESS bucket-DB write → run inside prod_safe_setup
)
```

- **`safe_write=True`** (a `durable_transaction` / `transition` / repo write) → on prod the whole handler runs inside `prod_safe_setup`: pause Space → pull fresh → mutate → resume (auto, in `finally`). This is the clobber-proof path.
- **`safe_write=False` but `mutates=True`** → a **job launch** (`cut`, `hf-publish launch`, `ts launch`). It touches no DB in-process, so it must NOT pause (pausing would also break `--monitor`'s webhook) — but it still needs `--yes-prod`.
- **`mutates=False`** → read-only (no actor, no pause, no `--yes-prod`).
- **`--dev`** / **`--dry-run`** → never pauses (dev has no live Space; dry-run does no write).

`setup` now **refuses a direct prod `safe_write` outside a `prod_safe_setup` window** (`sys.exit(2)`), so a bare prod DB write can't regress past `run`. The Space re-pulls on boot (app.py = pull+migrate), so the edit is durable with no manual restart.

It guards **both** competing writers: the live Space (eliminated by the pause) and a **second concurrent admin run** — a TTL'd bucket advisory lock (`db/.admin_lock.json`, 20 min) is held across the whole pause→edit→resume window, so a second admin **aborts** (`admin lock held by '<login>' …`) rather than overlapping and un-pausing the Space mid-edit. A crashed holder's lock self-expires.
