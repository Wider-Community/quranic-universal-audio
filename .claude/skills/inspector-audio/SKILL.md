name: inspector-audio
description: Inspector audio subsystem — everything between bytes-on-disk and an `<audio>` element rendering audio in the browser, plus the extraction → bucket → inspector handoff that produces `reciters/<slug>/` in the first place. Covers both debugging AND building audio features.
when_to_use: Audio bug reports AND new audio/playback/waveform feature work. Anything CBR/VBR, peaks, bucket audio/peaks lifecycle, ffmpeg, AudioPort, AudioGraph kill-switch, warmup, AudioRange, shadow-audio gapless, Xing TOC, the segment-clip route, the audio-proxy / audio_fetch / audio_source / audio_meta / peaks modules, the `/api/audio/surahs` dashboard-player metadata route, and the shared `dashPort`. Also the offline-extraction handoff: how `reciters/<slug>/` + the audio-manifest sidecar get written, the `auto_detect` reconciler firing `reciter.alignment_completed`, the three request kinds, the ALIGN / INGEST work queues, and the `POST /api/admin/intake/<rid>/ingest` mint flow.

# inspector-audio

Audio subsystem skill. Standalone — references below split by layer so the skill can grow new branches (per-codec, per-feature, per-platform) without bloating one doc.

Spans two arcs: the **runtime** path (bytes-on-disk → `<audio>`) and the **upstream handoff** (contributor source links → a reviewable `reciters/<slug>/` folder). The offline pipeline writes the bucket content; `auto_detect` reconciles it into the lifecycle. See `references/extraction-intake.md`.

## Two corrections to hold (the docs used to lie about both)

1. **The CDN tier is a same-origin 200/206 stream, not a 302.** `audio_source.resolve` is three tiers — local Path → in-mem bytes → CDN — and the CDN tier is served by `_stream_cdn` same-origin with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. The old 302 was removed because it silenced `<audio crossorigin>` + the Web Audio kill-switch. There is **no disk-cache tier**.
2. **No prefetch worker, no GC sweeper, `_done.json` not read at runtime.** Bucket audio + peaks are written once, offline, by Katana extraction and only **read** at runtime. Nothing warms the bucket, nothing GCs it. The reconciler keys on the DB state row (`AWAITING_ALIGNMENT`), not the sentinel. "Audio missing on the bucket" is an extraction/upload problem.

## Mode matrix

| Knob | Dev (`python3 inspector/app.py`) | Deployed (HF Space, gunicorn) |
|---|---|---|
| Audio source | bucket if mounted, else CDN stream-through every play | bucket NFS-mounted, sendfile via Path |
| Bucket | `hetchyy/quranic-inspector-bucket-dev` | bucket-dev (dev Space) / bucket (prod Space) |
| ffmpeg HTTPS reachability | full network | full network — image compiled with `--enable-openssl` + `file,pipe,http,https,tcp,tls` |
| Web Audio kill-switch | only fires once `ctx.state === 'running'` (post-warmup) | same |

VBR routing fork is **per-chapter**, not per-reciter. Decided by `audio_meta.is_vbr_for_url` server-side and the FE-shipped `reciter_vbr_chapters` list client-side. Same reciter can be CBR for chapter 1 and VBR for chapter 36.

## Conventions

- File-absolute milliseconds outside `AudioPort`, clip-relative inside. Any caller writing `el.currentTime` directly is a bug.
- Bucket audio + peaks are written offline (**Katana extraction** `audio_persist.py` + `upload_to_bucket.py`) and only **read** at runtime — no in-Space fetch worker, no GC sweeper. Audio + peaks persist indefinitely. (FE-side `warmup.ts` / `shadow-audio.ts` are *browser* warmups — HTTP Range / element-pool — unrelated to the removed backend worker.)
- Manifest sidecar `catalog/audio_manifest/<slug>.json` is the **single source of truth** for VBR routing and chapter ↔ URL reverse lookup (cached as `_audio_manifest` + an O(1) `_audio_manifest_url_index`). Built offline by `scripts/audio/probe_audio_meta.py`. Never resolve chapter URLs through `detailed.json` — its per-entry `audio` field is `""` post-migration-#5.
- Style across references: terse, table-first, file-path-anchored. When the live filesystem drifts, fix the matching reference — don't add a new layer.
- **This skill is the ground truth for audio** — by design there is no `docs/reference/audio.md` (`docs/reference/README.md` carves audio out to here). The reference docs only *touch* audio as thin pointers: the route map in `architecture.md`, the playback stores in `frontend.md`, audio manifests in `catalog.md`. Keep those thin and consistent with this skill; the depth lives here.

## Bucket layout (audio-relevant)

```
catalog/audio_manifest/<slug>.json    # per-chapter URL + size + duration + bitrate_kbps + bitrate_mode
reciters/<slug>/audio/<chapter>.mp3   # Katana-written, Xing-injected if source is VBR
reciters/<slug>/audio/_done.json      # written last by extraction; offline audit/upload artifact only — NOT read at runtime
reciters/<slug>/peaks/<chapter>.json.gz   # slim int8 packed gzip (schema v3) — see references/peaks.md
```

Chapter keys: `"1"`..`"114"` for `by_surah`, `"<surah>:<ayah>"` for `by_ayah`. Audio + peaks persist indefinitely (no GC).

## What this subsystem deliberately doesn't do

No gapless / crossfade beyond the element-pool adopt (`shadow-audio.ts`, which is best-effort look-ahead, not sample-aligned crossfade). No HLS/DASH/adaptive bitrate. No DSP / EQ / loudness normalization (Web Audio gain is a kill-switch only). No on-the-fly transcoding beyond the Katana Xing inject + the segment-clip re-encode. No in-Space audio prefetch / re-bake / GC. rAF-bound boundary enforcement (~16 ms), not audio-clock-locked. Acceptable for review; not for sub-frame timing edits.
