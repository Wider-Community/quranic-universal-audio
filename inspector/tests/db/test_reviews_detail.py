"""Coverage for ``services.admin.reviews.get_review_detail`` — the per-slug
payload behind the admin Reviews General drawer (``GET /api/admin/reviews/<slug>``).

This path had ZERO coverage, which is how the missing ``mark_ready_*`` columns
(see ``test_migration_0007``) shipped a 500 on every detail fetch. These tests
exercise the under-review and marked-ready shapes the drawer actually opens on.
