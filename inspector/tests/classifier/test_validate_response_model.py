"""``/api/seg/validate`` producer → ``SegValidateResponse`` wire-model guard.

The route serializes the live validation result through ``SegValidateResponse``
(``model_validate`` then ``model_dump``). Every item model is
``ConfigDict(extra="forbid")``, so any key a producer emits that the model does
NOT declare raises ``extra_forbidden`` → HTTP 500 for the whole validation panel
(segments don't display). This drives the REAL ``_build_detail_lists`` producer
and asserts its output round-trips through the wire model — the regression guard
for that class.

Specifically covers the ``basmala_amin`` "missed Basmala" path, which carries a
``time`` field (via the ``{**first_seg}`` spread) that the model omitted — the
exact gap that 500'd a reciter on the dev Space. The fixture-driven snapshot
test never triggers that path (it needs ``deleted_basmala_chapters`` across many
chapters), so it lives here.
