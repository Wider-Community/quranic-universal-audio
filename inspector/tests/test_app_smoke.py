"""Flask app smoke test.

Imports the module-level ``app`` from ``inspector/app.py`` and verifies that
the ``/api/surah-info`` route responds 200 with a JSON payload. Chosen as the
smoke target because it's a cross-tab route with no DB / disk-state
dependencies — it just returns ``load_surah_info_lite()``.

Import prerequisites handled in ``pyproject.toml`` (``pythonpath = ["."]``).
