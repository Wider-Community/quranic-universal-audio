"""Undo is a write, so it owes the same backend-owned stamps a save does.

The frontend's before-snapshot (``snapshotSeg``) carries only the fields the
editor can change, and ``source_ref`` / ``projection_support`` are not among
them — they are not even on the wire model the frontend sees. So restoring a
snapshot verbatim drops them, and for a projected delivery that is not
cosmetic: the timestamps engine refuses a run whose projected segments have no
``source_ref``, which would leave one undo blocking every later alignment.
