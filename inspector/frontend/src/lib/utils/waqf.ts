/**
 * Quranic waqf (stop) marks — the single source of stop-sign truth shared by the
 * Timestamps analysis view and the recitation teleprompter.
 *
 * Waqf marks are the small-high pause symbols (ۖ ۗ ۘ ۚ ۛ) that ride the Quranic
 * text as combining marks (Unicode category Mn) at the tail of a word's last
 * letter group. They are NOT pronounced, so they never appear in the MFA-aligned
 * `letters` array — only in the word's `display_text`. We surface one when the
 * reciter actually pauses on it.
 *
 * Excluded by design: U+06D9 (ۙ, "لا") means "do NOT stop here", and U+06DC
 * (ۜ, saktah) is a brief breathless hold, not a stop — a pause at either renders
 * the neutral pause token instead of a stop sign.
