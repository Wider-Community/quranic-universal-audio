/**
 * One-call chapter loader for the recitation-animation surfaces.
 *
 * Wraps the shard fetch + per-occasion assembly + chapter-absolute rebuild into
 * a single `loadChapterRecitation(reciter, chapter)` that returns the flat
 * `AnimUnit[]` + per-ayah boundaries the line animation and filmstrip consume —
 * or `null` when the reciter/chapter has no timestamps shard (caller hides the
 * section). Keeps the dashboard consumer free of any `tabs/*` import.
 *
 * Every occasion's words feed the build (no dedup), so each word's `intervals`
 * cover every recited occurrence (loopbacks / re-dos) — the recitation locator
 * spans the full chapter audio and the highlight travels back into a re-recited
 * verse instead of freezing on a single take.
 *
 * Scope guard: `buildChapterRecitation` recovers chapter-absolute word times by
 * adding back each occasion's offset, which is only correct for `by_surah`
 * reciters (one shared chapter file). `by_ayah` reciters have per-verse files
 * whose concatenation offsets aren't known here, so we return `null` for them.
