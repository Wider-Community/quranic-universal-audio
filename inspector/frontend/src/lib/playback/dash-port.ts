/**
 * Dashboard-tab AudioPort instance — shared by the Dashboard AND Timestamps
 * tabs via `BottomPlayer` (one element + transport so tab-switching cleanly
 * pauses one surface without touching the other).
 *
 * Dashboard plays full chapter MP3s (no VBR clip routing); the port is here
 * for transport uniformity and for App.svelte's tab-switch pause path. It
 * also supports `adoptElement` for the Timestamps gapless-shuffle swap.
 *
 * Kill-switch is intentionally disabled. Chapter URLs go through
 * `/api/seg/audio-proxy/...`, whose CDN tier is a SAME-ORIGIN 200/206 stream
 * with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` (no 302 redirect) — so proxied URLs
 * would route through `MediaElementAudioSourceNode` fine. But some dashboard
 * sources are RAW cross-origin (Quran.Foundation `qf_api` links served
 * directly, not via the proxy), and constructing a `MediaElementAudioSourceNode`
 * on a cross-origin element silences playback per the Web Audio spec. Full-
 * chapter playback doesn't need sample-accurate end-of-region cutoff, so we
 * keep the element on its default audio sink across the board.
