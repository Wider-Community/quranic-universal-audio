/**
 * Segments tab — Auto Split cursor map (client-side preload cache).
 *
 * Background: the Auto Split button (cross-verse + repetitions accordions)
 * resolves its cursor positions from an offline-precomputed sidecar
 * (`auto_split_v1.json`, keyed by `segment_uid`). The server holds the whole
 * map in process memory after the first read, but the FE historically re-POSTed
 * per click — one network round trip every click. On the deployed Space that
 * round trip (RTT + single-worker serialization) is the dominant latency.
 *
 * This store preloads the whole map ONCE (lazily, on auto-split accordion open)
 * via `GET /api/seg/auto-split/<reciter>`, so each click becomes a zero-network
 * O(1) lookup. Misses ("uid not in map") are classified client-side from the
 * segment's own `matched_ref` / `wrap_word_ranges`, so the per-uid POST's O(n)
 * `_find_segment_kind` scan is avoided too.
 *
 * Lifetime: reciter-scoped. The map content is stable across a session — the
 * sidecar is offline-computed, and edits only mint new uids that are legitimate
 * misses (the offline pass never saw them), so no per-edit invalidation is
 * needed. Cleared on reciter switch / stale reload via `clearAutoSplitMap`
 * (wired into `clear-per-reciter-state.ts`).
