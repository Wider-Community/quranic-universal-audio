/**
 * Active-row action registry — the bridge that lets the global keyboard
 * dispatcher (utils/keyboard.ts) invoke per-row / per-card edit actions without
 * re-deriving the target's DOM row, mountId, or validation category.
 *
 * The "primary" SegmentRow (the playing, non-context, editable row — in the
 * main list OR inside an open accordion card) publishes a callback bundle here.
 * Row-owned actions (adjust / split / edit-ref / goto / delete) are wired by
 * SegmentRow itself; card-owned actions (ignore / auto-fill / toggle-context)
 * are passed down as callbacks from the accordion card and forwarded into the
 * bundle. Keyboard shortcuts then call `get(activeRowActions)?.adjust?.()` etc.,
 * guaranteeing identical behaviour to clicking the row's buttons.
 *
 * `owner` is the publishing row's per-mount Symbol so a row only clears the
 * entry it actually set (twin rows / re-renders can't clobber each other).
