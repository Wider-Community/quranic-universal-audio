/**
 * Pure per-frame decision for the Timestamps tab's auto-random ("shuffle")
 * boundary, split out of `TimestampsTab`'s rAF tick so the contiguous-seam
 * overshoot race is unit-testable without rAF / audio / store plumbing.
 *
 * The tab focuses one OCCASION at a time (a contiguous recitation of a verse; a
 * re-recited verse yields several occasions). Occasions recited continuously are
 * contiguous (one's end == the next's start), so the playhead crosses a seam with
 * no gap. Each frame the tick must decide whether to FIRE the shuffle jump (the
 * auditioned occasion just ended) BEFORE it advances the visual focus — otherwise
 * a frame that overshoots the seam (heavy repaint right after a jump starves rAF,
 * most visible when the just-loaded occasion is short) would re-base the boundary
 * onto the NEXT occasion and leak it in full. Resolving the fire decision first,
 * against the auditioned occasion's captured end, bounds the leak to a single frame.
 *
 * A cross-source jump also opens a multi-frame window where the shared player
 * already points at the NEW chapter (so the playhead time is the new chapter's)
 * but the occasion list still describes the OLD chapter, until its data loads.
 * `resolveShuffleTick` reports `idle` for that window so the caller freezes both
 * focus and firing instead of interpreting the new time against stale occasions
 * (which would focus a wrong old occasion and double-fire the jump).
