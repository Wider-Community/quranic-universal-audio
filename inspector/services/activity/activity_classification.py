"""Visibility classifier for audit events — single source of truth.

Maps every state-machine event registered in ``services/state.py:_HANDLERS``
to one of two buckets:

- ``public`` — surfaced on the anonymous-visible Recent Activity rail.
- ``hidden`` — off the rail. Bulk/operational events, role administrivia,
  feedback-loop events (tombstones), and admin/maintainer-scoped events
  whose surface is now the **Admin dashboard** (Users / Requests / Reviews
  tabs) rather than a passive notifications feed.

The admin-only notifications rail was retired once the Admin dashboard
became self-contained (Reviews tab → marked-ready dot, per-row state, full
transition timeline; Users tab → per-user activity timeline; Requests tab →
intake / edit-request lifecycle). All former ``admin_only`` events live in
``HIDDEN_EVENTS`` now — still audited via ``transitions``, just not
surfaced as a notification card anywhere.

``services/public_activity`` reads this module so the feed can never drift
out of sync with the classifier. Adding a new event to ``state.py`` without
classifying it here trips
``test_anti_drift_every_state_handler_is_classified`` in the unit suite.
