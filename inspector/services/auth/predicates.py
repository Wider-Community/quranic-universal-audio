"""Server-side predicates for the ``/api/reciter-task/<slug>`` response.

Mirror of the spec in inspector-state-management.md §8 plus
``can_edit_as_admin`` (maintainer/owner override on UNDER_REVIEW rows) and
``can_edit_as_owner`` (owner editing any public row regardless of state or
marked_ready freeze — owner override is total).

Pure functions: each takes the row + optional ``User`` and returns ``bool``.
Anonymous (``user is None``) always yields ``False`` for any contribution
predicate. The frontend trusts these predicates to drive visibility but the
backend is authoritative — every mutating route re-checks state.
