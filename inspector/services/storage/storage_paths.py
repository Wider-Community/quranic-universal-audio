"""Pure path-string helpers for the bucket layout.

No I/O. No backend coupling. Single source for the on-bucket layout
documented in docs/planning/inspector-deploy/v2/inspector-data-storage.md §3.

IMPORTANT: The 7 legacy JSON stores (state, catalog, access, pending_requests,
request_archive shards, activity_state) and append-only audit JSONL are now
READ-ONLY backups. The SQLite database (``inspector.db``, uploaded whole-file
to the bucket after each committed write) is the sole source of truth.
Migration is one-shot; these helpers remain to support test fixtures and the
migration script itself.

Per-reciter CONTENT path helpers (detailed, segments, edit_history, peaks, audio,
etc.) are still actively used and unchanged.

Paths are returned as POSIX strings (forward slashes) regardless of host OS —
that's the wire format used by ``huggingface_hub.upload_file`` and the
``hf-mount`` driver. ``FilesystemBackend`` translates to native paths.
