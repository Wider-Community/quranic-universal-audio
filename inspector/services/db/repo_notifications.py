"""Per-user notification rows for the Dashboard "My Notifications" rail.

One row per (target user, source event), materialized at emit time by
``services.notifications`` (lifecycle transitions + segment-flag replies). Each
row is dismissable; dismissing sets ``dismissed_at`` (the row moves to the
archive but is retained + restorable). Dedup is on ``(hf_user_id, source_key)``
via ``INSERT OR IGNORE`` — a re-driven transaction or retried save can't
double-insert.

The caller owns the transaction: writes assume an active ``transaction()``
(the route's ``durable_transaction`` or the emit hook's live connection). Reads
use ``get_conn()`` directly. Mirrors ``repo_guides`` conventions.
