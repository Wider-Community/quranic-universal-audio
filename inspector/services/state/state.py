"""Reciter state service: reads/writes from SQLite ``delivery_states`` + ``claims`` tables.

Single source of truth for reciter lifecycle + assignee. Inspector backend
is sole writer. The SQLite DB (via ``repo_state``, ``repo_claims``) is the
canonical store; writes commit atomically via ``durable_transaction``.

The full state machine ships in Phase 1 even though most endpoint callers
land in later phases — the dispatcher is the single source of truth and
later phases just add routes. Per-event payload shapes are colocated below
as ``TypedDict``s so callers know exactly what each event expects.

Spec:
- docs/planning/inspector-deploy/v2/inspector-state-management.md §4
  (canonical event vocabulary + transition matrix)
- docs/planning/inspector-deploy/v2/phases/state-machine.md
  (admin diagram + state-preserving actions)
