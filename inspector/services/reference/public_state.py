"""Public state mapper for the Phase 6 dashboard.

Translates the internal ``ReciterRow`` + catalog delivery + reciter into the
six-bucket public taxonomy and strips assignee identity from every payload.
Never reveals slugs in user-facing copy — the slug is included only as a
stable client-side ID for grouping / picker selection, never rendered to the
user. See ``inspector/CLAUDE.md`` for the slug-exposure rule.

The public surface aggregates by reciter (one row per ``reciter_id``) and
embeds the reciter's deliveries inline. The dashboard frontend renders one
reciter row + an inline-expandable deliveries sub-table, so backend doing
the aggregation keeps the UI thin and the data shape unambiguous.

Authoritative spec:
- Phase 6 contract: docs/planning/inspector-deploy/v2/phases/06-public-dashboard.md
- Public taxonomy + activity feed: §1, §"Public activity feed"

Slice B of phase 6.
