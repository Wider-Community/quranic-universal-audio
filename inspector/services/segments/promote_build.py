"""Build the published ``reciters/<slug>/`` artifacts from a staged run.

The build half of promote, shared by two writers: ``scripts/bucket/promote_run.py``
(a Katana/offline run fetched from ``staging/``) and the native align pipeline
(``services/admin/align_pipeline/stage_assemble.py``, whose staged run is
materialised in-process). Nothing here writes to the bucket.

Every Inspector-side derivation the batch pipeline deliberately leaves undone
happens here, through Inspector's own writers rather than a second copy of them:
``services.segments.stamping`` for the persisted classifier fields,
``domain.identity.derive_uid`` for segment identity, ``services.audio.peaks`` +
``peaks_slim`` for chapter peaks, ``services.audio.op_peaks`` for the per-op
history-peaks records, and ``adapters.segments_json`` for ``segments.json``.
The staged shapes are read through ``qua_shared.schemas.bucket.staged_run``.

The one derivation that needs care is the waqf-sakt UID: it is derived once from
``final_index`` and reaches both the persisted row and the published operation,
never by assignment onto the read-only event model. See ``stamp_waqf_uids``.
