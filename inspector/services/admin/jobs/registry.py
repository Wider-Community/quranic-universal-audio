"""Unified job aggregation for the admin **Jobs** tab.

Reads the one job-record store (``records.list_all``) and merges it with the
live HF job list (``base.list_in_flight_jobs``), deduping by ``job_id`` and
preferring the live ``running`` status. This is the single source the Jobs tab
renders — no DB stitching, because every kind now records uniformly at launch +
completion (``services/admin/jobs/records.py``).
