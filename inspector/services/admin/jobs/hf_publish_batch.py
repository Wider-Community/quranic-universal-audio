"""HF dataset publish kind — BATCH push (one job, many recitations).

Launches a single HF Job that runs ``qua_jobs/publish_hf_batch.py`` over a list
of slugs. The job publishes each slug's split independently (one slug failing
never aborts the batch) and reports a per-slug ``members`` array — succeeded
members carry the HF revision SHA, failed members carry an error string.

On completion the batch webhook → ``complete()`` inserts one
``per_recitation_releases(track='hf', ...)`` row per *succeeded* member (reusing
``hf_publish.complete``, idempotent) and leaves the failures to surface via the
durable batch record at ``jobs/_global/hf_publish_batch/<job_id>.json``. That
record (written by the job) is the source of truth for the Releases-tab
"Failed to publish" bucket + summary banner; the poll fallback reads it when no
webhook payload is available.

The HF Job NEVER writes the DB.
