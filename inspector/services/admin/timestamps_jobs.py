"""Fire + inspect timestamps runs on the batch timing Space.

Flask-free. The Reviews tab triggers ``launch()`` for an under-review reciter;
the whole-verse MFA producer runs on the batch timing Space (ADR 0002 slice B),
which reads detailed.json + audio and writes v13 per-chapter shards +
``ts_validation.json`` into the inspector bucket. The Space also writes a
durable run-log record at ``reciters/<slug>/jobs/ts/<run_id>.json`` (settings +
status + logs) — ``running`` at accept, then ``succeeded``/``failed`` when the
run ends. Status is that record (``job_status`` reads it); the run id is
appended to the reciter's ``timestamps_job_ids``.

Launching does NOT transition the reciter — it stays UNDER_REVIEW (marked_ready)
while the run proceeds, so a failed run is recoverable (just re-run). On
*success* ``complete_timestamps_job`` takes one of two paths by current state:

  - **First publish** (under_review marked_ready) → fires ``reciter.published``
    (→ released) with ``SYSTEM_ACTOR``.
  - **Regenerate** (already released) → NO transition (there is no
    released → released edge). It records the new ``ts`` release, supersedes the
    prior one, stamps the slug's HF/GH releases stale, and writes a
    ``reciter.ts_regenerated`` audit event so the operator is driven to
    re-publish from the Releases tab.

``complete_timestamps_job`` runs as the idempotent ``job_status`` poll fallback
when the drawer sees a terminal-success record. It is idempotent on the
``(track='ts', slug, version=run_id)`` triple, so a repeated poll dispatch is a
no-op after the first.
