"""Stage 2 — align every chapter on the aligner Space, staging each raw result.

One alignment-only batch, one streamed item per chapter by bucket reference
(``hf://buckets/<repo>/reciters/<slug>/audio/<ch>.mp3``). Chapters already staged
are skipped, so a resumed or retried run only pays for what is left. Transient
transport failures retry the chapter; a ``batch_not_found`` (the Space restarted,
or its in-memory registry expired) recreates the batch; a ZeroGPU quota refusal
flips the rest of the run to the CPU lane.

Chapters run **concurrently**, as wide as the batch allows: a GPU batch
advertises ``max_in_flight = 0`` (no limit) and every remaining chapter goes at
once. ZeroGPU takes one lease per request, so the items overlap everywhere —
bucket fetch, decode, and the leased segmentation/ASR/matching itself — and the
quota decides where that stops. The item that exhausts it falls back to the CPU
lane, which the Space admits through its own gate, so nothing here needs a cap.
