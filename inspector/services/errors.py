"""Shared error-envelope builder + stable machine codes.

Every JSON error the API returns is the flat, additive shape::

    {"error": <human-readable message>, "code": <stable code>,
     "context": {...}?, "details": {...}?}

``error`` is plain prose safe to surface to a user; ``code`` is a stable
machine constant the frontend maps to friendly copy (so a raw backend string
never has to reach a user); ``context`` carries display data (e.g. a humanized
state label) and ``details`` carries structured payloads (e.g. mark-ready
category counts). ``context``/``details`` are omitted when empty.

This is intentionally tiny — a pure dict builder, no exception hierarchy and
no Flask coupling. Routes/decorators wrap ``error_body`` into a response via
``api_error`` (in ``utils/decorators.py``); the app-level ``StateError``
handlers (app.py) build the same shape directly from ``error_body``.
