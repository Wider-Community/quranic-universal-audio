"""Claim / release / mark / unmark + reciter-task routes.

These endpoints mutate the bucket state file directly via
``state.transition``; no ``require_edit_lock`` here — state.py handlers
own the ownership + precondition checks and raise:

- ``InvalidTransition`` → 400 (mapped at app errorhandler).
- ``NotAuthorizedForTransition`` → 403 (mapped at app errorhandler).
- ``UnknownReciter`` → 404 (mapped at app errorhandler).

The route's job is: authenticate, do the one-claim-per-user pre-check
(application policy, not part of the state machine), build the ``Actor``,
dispatch the transition, and return the authoritative row.
