"""Adapter: incoming save payload -> canonical segment dicts.

Provides ``make_seg`` — extracted from ``services/save.py:_make_seg`` — as the
single lookup+merge logic for building a canonical segment from a payload
segment dict plus existing on-disk segments.  ``services/save.py`` calls this
adapter internally; the route shape is unchanged (MUST-1).
