"""Publish-time boundary validators for v2 dataset/release artifacts.

Four hard-fail checks per the v2 plan §Boundary enforcement. Called from both
``qua_jobs/publish_hf.py`` and ``qua_jobs/cut_release.py`` *before* the
artifact is written. Failures block the publish and surface the offending
verses in ``validation_summary``.

Input shape is the source-relative per-verse map produced by re-stitching
``reciters/<slug>/timestamps/<chapter>.json.gz`` shards back together. Each
verse entry is the canonical projection used by the FE today:

    {
      "verse_start_ms": int,
      "verse_end_ms":   int,
      "duration_ms":    int,            # verse_end - verse_start
      "words":          [(widx, s, e), ...],
      "segments":       [(word_from, word_to, s, e), ...],
    }

Times throughout are source-relative ms.
