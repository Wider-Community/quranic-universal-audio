"""Readers for a staged generation run — the batch pipeline's handoff to promote.

One run stages a ``candidates/<chapter>.json`` per chapter, one ``events.json``,
and a ``manifest.json`` naming and hashing every staged file.
``scripts/bucket/promote_run.py`` reads exactly these shapes and writes
``reciters/<slug>/``.

The producer's models live in the monorepo (``qua_contracts.generation``), which
cannot be installed here — so these are mirrors, not imports. They declare only
what promote consumes and are ``extra="ignore"``, which is what lets the producer
add a field without a coordinated release here. The three golden files under
``fixtures/`` are byte-identical copies of the producer's own, and
``qua_shared/tests/test_staged_run.py`` is the executable half of the contract.

A pre-stamp event cannot validate as an ``EditOperation``: it carries no ``op_id``
and a top-level ``chapter`` that model forbids. ``stamp_operation`` is the one
conversion, and it builds snapshot **dicts** — the type ``EditOperation``'s
``targets_before`` / ``targets_after`` actually declare, because a snapshot carries
``chapter`` / ``audio_url`` / ``index_at_save`` that ``DetailedSegment`` forbids.
``PipelineAuditEvent`` is a read-only view: nothing is ever assigned onto it.
