"""Per-reciter ``detailed.json`` segment schema.

Shared source of truth for the per-segment shape inside
``reciters/<slug>/detailed.json``.
Both the offline extraction pipeline (`.local/extraction/segments/outputs.py`)
and the Inspector save flow (`inspector/services/segments/save.py`) MUST
round-trip through this model — that is the structural fix for the
writer/reader drift we discovered in migration #4 + #5 (see
``docs/reference/data-migrations.md`` §5).

``DetailedDocument`` wraps ``_meta`` + ``entries[]``; ``DetailedEntry``
wraps a per-chapter group; ``DetailedSegment`` is the atomic unit and
where 99% of the bytes live.

Extras handling: pure ``extra="forbid"`` on every model — any unexpected
field raises ``ValidationError``. Writers emit via
``model_dump(exclude_none=True)`` so optional fields with no value don't
land as ``null`` in the JSON. Snapshot fields (``chapter``, ``audio_url``,
``index_at_save``) used inside edit-history operations DO NOT live on a
persisted seg — they're modelled separately on ``SegSnapshot`` for op
payloads.

        canonical refs, or a special token (``"Basmala"``, ``"Isti'adha"``,
        ``"Amin"``, ``"Takbir"``, ``"Tahmeed"``, ``"Tasleem"``, ``"Sadaqa"``)
        for transition segs that get stripped by the post-pass.

      - ``qalqala_letter`` — last Arabic letter when it's in the qalqala set
        (ق ط ب ج د), else ``None``. Default ``None`` for legacy data.
      - ``is_boundary_adj`` — pad-floor boundary flag (structural + phoneme
        tail). Default ``False`` for legacy data.

    Optional content fields:
      - ``confidence`` — DP alignment confidence in ``[0.0, 1.0]``. Failed
        alignments get ``0.0``.
      - ``wrap_word_ranges`` — repetition-wrap geometry. Truthy iff the seg
        contains a multi-pass recital pattern. The ``repetitions``
        validation category triggers ONLY off this field.
      - ``segment_uid`` — UUIDv7 stamped by save-flow merge / split / strip
        ops and by the ``/seg/all`` lazy backfill route. Absent on fresh
        extraction output.
      - ``word_timings`` — per-word spans carried by an uploaded sample (or a
        maintainer realign). Edits keep the words that still fit the seg's
        span and ref and drop the rest; absent on pipeline deliveries.
      - ``ignored_categories`` — per-seg category-level ignore set written
        by the "ignore this issue" accordion action; consulted by
        ``services/validation/classifier.py::is_ignored_for`` to suppress
        the listed categories from the validation accordion. ``["_all"]``

        boolean. See ``docs/proposals/ignored-categories-refactor.md``
        for the proposed move to a chapter-level sidecar.
      - ``ignored`` — pre-categories boolean wildcard, kept for back-compat
        read of legacy on-disk data. Save writes ``ignored_categories``
        with ``["_all"]`` instead.
