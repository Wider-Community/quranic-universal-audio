"""Unified job record — the single shape every job kind persists.

One store, one schema. The Inspector server writes a ``JobRecord`` to the
bucket for **every** kind (``timestamps`` / ``hf_publish`` /
``hf_publish_batch`` / ``cut_release`` / ``refresh_catalog``) at launch
(``status="running"``) and at every terminal point (``succeeded`` /
``failed``), via ``services/admin/jobs/records.py``. The DB stays the
source-of-truth for *releases*; this record is the uniform observability /
audit artifact that the admin **Jobs** tab reads from one place.

``JobRecord`` is a superset of the legacy ``TsJobRecord`` (which the TS HF-Job
container still self-writes, unchanged) — old TS records parse cleanly into it
(same field names + ``extra="allow"``). ``records.read`` injects ``kind`` from
the bucket path when an older record lacks it.
