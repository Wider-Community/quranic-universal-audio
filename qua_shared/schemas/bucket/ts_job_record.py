"""Timestamps-generation job record — persisted per HF Job run.

Written to ``jobs/ts/<job_id>.json`` on the bucket (top-level ``jobs/<type>/``
namespace, future-proof for other job kinds). Two writers, one schema:

- ``inspector/services/admin/timestamps_jobs.py`` writes the initial
  ``running`` record at launch and backstops the terminal status on poll if
  the job was hard-killed before self-writing.
- ``qua_jobs/generate_timestamps.py`` (the job itself) overwrites the
  record with the final status + full logs on completion/failure.

The Reviews-tab side panel reads these so a job's settings + logs stay
viewable any time after completion (HF log retention is limited). See
``docs/planning/inspector-deploy/v2/phases/13-timestamps-job.md`` and the
approved side-panel plan.
