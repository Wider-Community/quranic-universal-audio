"""Per-reciter ``edit_history.jsonl`` v2 schema.

Per-batch ledger for in-app History panel browsing. v2 changes from v1:
- adds ``actor: {hf_user_id, login_at_time, role}``
- drops the file-hash chain (``file_hash_after``)
- drops the genesis record

The parser still detects + skips v0/v1 genesis records so mixed files read
without a migration script (``parse_edit_history_line`` returns ``None`` for
them), but every non-genesis batch is validated under pure ``extra="forbid"``:
an unexpected field raises ``ValidationError`` rather than being stripped.

Spec: docs/planning/inspector-deploy/v2/inspector-deployment-plan.md §7 +
inspector-data-storage.md §8.
