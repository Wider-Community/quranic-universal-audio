"""Capability registry — the canonical, data-driven authorization vocabulary.

Inspector authorization used to be hardcoded role math (``is_maintainer`` /
``is_owner`` checks scattered across state handlers, route decorators, and
predicates). This module replaces the *vocabulary* of that model: every gated
action is a named ``Capability`` with a per-tier default that encodes the
**current** behavior exactly. An owner can deviate from these defaults at
runtime via ``permission_overrides`` (see ``services/db/repo_permissions.py``);
the resolver (``services/auth/capabilities.py``) overlays overrides on these
defaults and is the single authoritative gate.

Design rules baked in here:

- ``OWNER`` is never a key in ``default_grants`` — owners are superusers and
  always pass ``can()``. The matrix only governs ANONYMOUS / CONTRIBUTOR /
  MAINTAINER.
- ``manage_permissions`` is ``owner_only_fixed`` — it is the recovery anchor
  (only owners can ever change permissions, so the system can never be locked
  out) and is never toggleable. The resolver hard-codes it owner-only.
- ``anon_eligible`` capabilities are the only ones where ANONYMOUS is a real
  toggle. Action capabilities that need a signed-in identity (claim a row,
  edit, submit) are NOT anon-eligible — the UI renders their anonymous cell as
  N/A and the resolver refuses an anonymous grant even if a row exists.
- ``default_grants`` == today's *effective* behavior (the tighter of route +
  handler). e.g. ``reciter.undiscard`` is owner-only because the route is
  ``@require_role(OWNER)`` even though the state handler is maintainer-level.
  An empty ``permission_overrides`` table therefore reproduces the legacy
  system bit-for-bit (guarded by a parity test).

This module is backend + registry data only; it is NOT codegen'd to the FE.
The FE consumes the transformed ``admin_permissions`` response models instead.
