"""Public dashboard ``/api/public/*`` wire schemas.

Response models for the read-only public catalog surface served by
``inspector/routes/public/public.py`` and built in
``inspector/services/reference/public_state.py``. They model the exact dict
shape the routes emit (the source of truth), replacing the hand-mirrored
TypedDicts in ``public_state.py`` and the TS interfaces in
``inspector/frontend/src/lib/types/public-state.ts``.

Shapes
------
- ``PublicBucket`` — the public lifecycle taxonomy the FE switches on. Five
  buckets only; the route's ``_VALID_BUCKETS`` filter allowlist additionally
  accepts a phantom ``"publishing"`` that no payload ever carries (no
  ``_STATE_TO_BUCKET`` mapping produces it) — it is intentionally NOT part of
  this type.
- ``PublicDelivery`` — one (reciter, riwayah, style, source, channel) combo.
  ``bucket_dates`` / ``ts_refresh_dates`` are attached only on the modal
  (detail / admin-view) paths, absent on the cached list — modelled optional.
- ``PublicReciter`` — one reciter row with its public deliveries inline +
  rolled-up facets. Served by ``GET /api/public/reciters`` (paginated) and
  ``GET /api/public/reciter/<id>`` (anonymous / contributor callers).
- ``AdminDiscardedDelivery`` — a ``PublicDelivery`` plus ``visibility`` +
  ``visibility_reason``; only appears in ``AdminViewReciter.discarded_deliveries``.
- ``AdminViewReciter`` — the maintainer / owner shape of
  ``GET /api/public/reciter/<id>``: public combos in ``deliveries`` plus the
  hidden combos pulled into ``discarded_deliveries`` + a ``fully_discarded`` flag.
- ``PublicReciterPage`` — the ``{reciters, total, next_cursor}`` envelope of
  ``GET /api/public/reciters``.
- ``BucketCounts`` — the per-bucket reciter tally of ``GET /api/public/stats``.

Response models, so ``ConfigDict(extra="forbid")`` (we own the producer). Dump
with ``exclude_none=True`` so the modal-only optionals vanish on list payloads.
