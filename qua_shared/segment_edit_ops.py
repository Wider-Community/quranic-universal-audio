"""Which segment edit operations change the generated timestamps artifact.

Single source of truth for "does this edit make the generated timestamps
stale?". An edit affects timestamps when it moves a segment boundary
(trim/split/merge/delete) OR changes which ayah a segment maps to
(edit_reference/auto_fix_missing_word) — both alter the per-verse timestamps
doc a regeneration would produce. Pure annotations/comments
(confirm_reference, ignore_issue, flag_segment, set_is_wasl) never touch the
artifact and are intentionally excluded.

The op_type vocabulary is fixed by ``OP_TYPE_BY_COMMAND`` in the FE
``tabs/segments/domain/apply-command.ts`` (auto-split has no distinct op_type
— it commits as a normal ``split`` → ``split_segment``). The FE mirrors this
set with a lockstep comment; keep them in step.

Consumed by ``services/segments/ts_staleness.py`` (the Releases-tab TS-stale
signal) and ``services/segments/history_tiers.py`` (the history "pending
regen" highlight).
