"""Structural audit for a word-profile timestamp shard (schema 14).

The native v13 audit proves identity closure over cells, sounds and rule
occurrences. A word shard has none of those, so the equivalent guarantees are
different in kind but the same in spirit: every word the parts claim exists,
every interval is ordered and sits inside the part that owns it, no two words
in one reading overlap, and the text came from the edition index the meta
names.

The last check is the important one. A word row carries *exact target text*
that the Segments and Timestamps tabs render directly; if it were allowed to
drift from the edition index the shard would silently show one edition's script
under another's coordinates. ``words_sha256`` pins the index *revision*, which
is not the same claim — so every row's text is compared against the index
itself, ref by ref. Both checks need ``qua_domain``; without it they are
skipped, not weakened, and a Hafs-only deployment never writes a word shard.
