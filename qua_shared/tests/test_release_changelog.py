"""Tests for the shared release-changelog renderer.

``qua_shared/release_changelog.py`` is the single source of truth for the GH
release body, used by both the cut HF Job and the Inspector cut-modal preview.
These guard the format contract: title first, asset table first, display names
only (no slugs), concise guide copy, and two collapsed schema sections.
