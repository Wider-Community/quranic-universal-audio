"""The ``qua-domain`` pin is written in three places; they must not drift.

``qua_shared/qua_domain_pin.py`` is the source. The installer reads it. The
Dockerfile CANNOT read it — HF Spaces build with no build args, so its
``ARG QUA_COMMIT`` default is the pin as far as a deployed Space is concerned.
That duplication is unavoidable, so it is pinned here instead.
