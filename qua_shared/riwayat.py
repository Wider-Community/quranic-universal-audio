"""Which riwayat Universal Audio supports, and how their slugs map to the SDK.

Single source of truth for the riwayah vocabulary boundary. Two slug spaces
exist and they do NOT agree:

- **Inspector slugs** — the ``riwayahs.slug`` column and every
  ``catalog.deliveries[].riwayah`` value (``qalon_an_nafi``, ``shubah_an_asim``).
  Twenty rows exist in the vocabulary; only the four below are supported.
- **SDK slugs** — what ``qua_domain`` / ``qua_sdk`` speak (``qalun``, ``shuba``).

This module is deliberately an explicit table rather than a call to
``qua_domain.normalize_riwayah``, for two reasons:

1. ``normalize_riwayah`` raises ``ValueError`` on ``qalon_an_nafi`` and
   ``shubah_an_asim`` today — its alias table has ``qaloonannafi`` and
   ``shubah`` but not those spellings. The upstream fix is separate; the
   Inspector must not be blocked on it.
2. ``qua_domain`` is an optional dependency (see
   ``services/reference/editions.py``). Slug support must be answerable on a
   Hafs-only deployment where the package is not installed.

A parity test asserts this table agrees with ``normalize_riwayah`` for all four
entries whenever ``qua_domain`` IS importable, so the two can never silently
diverge.

Re-exported to the frontend as ``RiwayatConfig`` through
``qua_shared/schemas/fe_types.py`` — FE code compares against the generated
constant, never a bare ``short !== 'hafs'``.
