"""The pinned ``Hetchy/qua`` revision the edition data is built from.

``qua-domain`` is not on PyPI — it is a package inside the private monorepo,
installed from an exact commit. This module is the single place that commit is
written down, so the local installer, the Docker build stage, and the boot-time
provenance assertion cannot disagree.

Bump it like a lockfile entry: change ``QUA_COMMIT``, run
``python scripts/devenv/install_qua_domain.py``, and commit. A test asserts the
Dockerfile's ``ARG QUA_COMMIT`` default matches this value, because HF Spaces
build without build args — the Dockerfile literal is the pin on the Space.

Credentials never live here. The installer reads an SSH deploy key from
``QUA_DOMAIN_DEPLOY_KEY`` (CI and the image build) or falls back to whatever
git credential the developer already has for the monorepo.
